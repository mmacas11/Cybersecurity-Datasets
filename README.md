## Network Intrusion Detection
* [KDD Cup 1999:](https://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html) was created based on the DARPA 1998 dataset and inherit the same problems. Nevertheless, it is one of the most employed datasets until now for network intrusion detection. KDDCup99 includes full-packet data, break into subsets for training and testing. The network traffic is labeled in five classes: Normal, Probe, User to Root attacks, Remote to Local attacks, and DoS attacks. 
* NSL-KDD:
* [CTU-13:](https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-ctu13) is a dataset of botnet traffic captured in the CTU University, Czech Republic, in 2011. The dataset aimed to have a large capture of real botnet traffic mixed with normal and background traffic. The CTU-13 dataset includes thirteen captures (i.e., scenarios) of different botnet samples. In each scenario, we executed a specific malware, which employed several protocols and performed different actions. 
* [AWID:](https://icsdweb.aegean.gr/awid/) focuses on 802.11 networks. A small network environment with ten clients was designed to capture WLAN traffic in a packet-based format. In one hour, around 2 million packets were captured. 155 features were extracted from each packet. For generating malicious traffic, 15 specific attacks against the 802.11 network (e.g., Probe Request, and CTS Flooding) were executed. The dataset is labeled and divided into a training and a test subset.
