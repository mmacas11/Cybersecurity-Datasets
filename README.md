## Network Intrusion Detection
* KDD Cup 1999:

* NSL-KDD:

* CTU-13: This dataset includes botnet, normal, and background traffic captured at the Czech Technical University in Prague (CTU), in 2011. It contains the raw packet data (PCAP files) and considers 13 scenarios with different botnet attacks.
* UNB ISCX 2012: It was created by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity of the University of New Brunswick (UNB), in 2012. Traffic was captured in an emulated network environment over a period of seven days, following a dynamic approach according to which $\alpha$-profiles described attack scenarios and $\beta-$profiles characterized normal user behavior.
* AWID: It is a labeled dataset that focuses on 802.11 networks. A small network environment with ten clients was designed to capture the WLAN traffic in a packet-based format, while 15 specific attacks (e.g., Probe Request, and CTS Flooding) were executed.
* CIC-IDS2017: This dataset was also created by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity and contains different types of user profiles (generating background traffic) and multistage attacks(e.g., Heartbleed, DoS and DDoS).  It has 80 network traffic features that are extracted using the CICFlowMeter tool. User profiles were based on the abstract behavior of 25 users working with the HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, and email protocols. 
* CSE-CIC-IDS2018: contains six types of network attacks (i.e., DoS, DDoS, Botnet, brute-force, infiltration, and web attacks) and was generated based on synthetic user profiles, which capture abstract representations of network events and behaviors. Fifty network nodes were used to attack the victim infrastructure consisting of 420 computers and 30 servers. It has 84 network traffic features extracted using the CICFlowMeter-V3 tool.
* CIC-DDoS2019: includes many different DDoS attacks carried out through application layer protocols using TCP/UDP. It was collected in two separate days for training (12 types of DDoS attacks) and testing (7 types of DDoS attacks), and is available in both PCAP file and flow format. 
* LITNET-2020:  contains feature vectors generated during 12 attacks on general computers deployed on an academic network. It was collected for a period of 10 months. In total, it holds 26.9 GB of vectors with 85 processed flow features extracted using Netflow.
* TON_IoT: was generated in 2019 by Abdullah et al.~\cite{Alsaedi2020}, and includes different types of IoT data (e.g., operation system logs, telemetry data), as well as IoT network traffic collected from a medium-scale network at the Cyber Range and IoT Labs of the UNSW Canberra, Australia. 
* IoT-23: is a dataset consisting of 20 captures that include malware activity and 3 captures of benign IoT traffic.
