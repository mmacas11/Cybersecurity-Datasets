## Network Intrusion Detection
* KDD Cup 1999:

* NSL-KDD:

* CTU-13: This dataset includes botnet, normal, and background traffic captured at the Czech Technical University in Prague (CTU), in 2011. It contains the raw packet data (PCAP files) and considers 13 scenarios with different botnet attacks.
* UNB ISCX 2012: It was created by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity of the University of New Brunswick (UNB), in 2012. Traffic was captured in an emulated network environment over a period of seven days, following a dynamic approach according to which $\alpha$-profiles described attack scenarios and $\beta-$profiles characterized normal user behavior.
